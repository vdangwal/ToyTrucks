need to make sure catalog Inventory and Inventory api are in sync on startup
so need to also put inventoryapi quantity into each truck in catalogapi. This needs to happen at startup. 
It will then be used by webpage quantity combobox
when inventory updated, need to publish inventory updated event to be consumed by catalogapi
need to update teh truck inventory quantity with new quantity and also set outofstock to true if true

THen need to update basket.
Add OutOfStock to basket. If quantity is now 0 then set OutOfStock to true. Total is for all baskets whose OutOfStock = false
